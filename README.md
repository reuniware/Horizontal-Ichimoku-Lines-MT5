# Horizontal-Ichimoku-Lines-MT5
Finds horizontal Ichimoku lines (Eg. Kijun Sen Flat Lines)

File TenkanSenHorizontalLines.mq5 detects Tenkan Sen flat lines and show them on MT5 graph. It has some source code added for coloring lines. Then Kijun Sen lines detection is still in the code but is commented.

File KS_TS_SSB_Ichimoku_Horizontal_Lines.mq5 detects Tenkan and Kijun and Senkou Span B horizontal lines. It is the most complete code.

SSB lines are dotted lines (check the EURUSD.PNG file to have an example of visual output of this EA).

Contact me at investdatasystems@yahoo.com if you have projects around Ichimoku or around quant programming.

I am based in Paris, France, but can work on international projects also.
